      Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, from diagnostic tools to robotic surgeries.
      One of the key areas where AI is making a significant impact is in predictive analytics. By analyzing vast datasets, AI can help healthcare providers predict outbreaks, patient outcomes, and even personalize treatment plans based on individual patient data.
      The use of AI-driven diagnostic tools can also improve the accuracy of disease detection, reducing the risk of human error in medical diagnosis. This can be particularly useful in areas like radiology, where AI can assist in analyzing medical images such as X-rays or MRIs more quickly and accurately than human doctors.
